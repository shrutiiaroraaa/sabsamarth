##INTRODUCTION

सबSamarth is a potential public empowerment app to be developed and designed to improve and systamise information flow hence improving transparency and efficiency of the workflow of any concerned authority.

As depicted by its name, the app/ website attempts to empower every citizen by making information accessible and authorities easily approachable to them via a user friendly communication channel. This app/ website also focuses on bringing the works of authorities to light and enables people to verify them(works) personally and potentially anonymously hence improving the overall transparency of the workflow.


##FUNCTIONING

It authenticates using Aadhar. Every user has a “profile” and “What's happening” pages  सबSamarth makes you a part of a digital network corresponding to where you live, hence creating a digital society. It showcases the hierarchy of authorities in your area to make them more recognizable and approachable.

The core functioning of this app is based on “posting” of location centric possible improvements and addressing problems transparency.

If an “issue” is posted by someone, it can be backed up by people living nearby hence determining the overall severity/importance of the issue. People can then support the cause and take a legal approach to address the issue together, while it is visible to everyone. This intends to bring in more people working towards the process of improvement in our societies. One shares issues that have been noted or addressed in other regions, making flow of good ideas faster.

When an issue is resolved by anyone in the society(verified by the masses) it shows the same on one's profile, giving them credibility in the society. Problems unaddressed yet severe and well documented may be automatically transferred to a person of higher power, within a given amount of time making insincerity accountable.

This app/website wishes to develop a more transparent form of e-governance, if promoted by the government. It craves to reduce corruption and improve regional development.
